This file gives a brief guide to the "Best Answer" Module.

Last Updated: 5/2/11 by Chip Cleary

This module extends the "Answers" module. See http://drupal.org/projects/answers 

It offers new functionality for 4 of the 5 roles which Answers supports:
1	** Viewers: Those who view questions and answers
2	** Question Authors: Those who ask a question.
3	** Answer Authors: Those who answer a question
4	** Site Administrator: Those who have the "administer settings" privilege and who can set up the module
5	Site Developer: Those who code sites using modules

What the module does:
•	Question Authors can select a "Best Answer" from the answers provided to their questions.
•	After a Best Answer is selected, it is shown first in the set of answers to its questions.
•	The Site Administrator can specify whether questions should be "locked" after a Best Answer is selected
•	If the locked functionality is set and a Best Answer is selected for a question, viewers are no longer able to post answers to it

Below is a summary by role of what the module does. This is *in addition* to the base functionality of Answers.

1. Viewer Role: The module also redefines the list views which Answers provides
•	'questions/all': A list of questions (unchanged)
•	'questions/answered': A list of "answered" questions (new). Questions for which a "Best Answer" has been selected.
•	'questions/unresolved': A list of "unresolved" questions (new). Questions which have answers but no "Best Answer"
•	'questions/unanswered': A list of "unaswered" questions (unchanged).
•	'questions/search': A form to search for questions

2. Question Author Role:
•	Question Authors can select (or change) a "Best Answer"

3. Answer Author Role:
•	If a "Best Answer" has been chosen for a question and the lock feature is set, authors can no longer post new answers to that question.

4. Site Administrator Role: Site Administrators can define:
•	Whether questions should be "locked" when a "Best Answer" is selected. To set this:
    - Go to "admin/settings/answers"
	- Set the checkbox labeled "Lock questions after a "Best Answer" has been selected?"

5. Site Developer Role: 
<no new functionality>
